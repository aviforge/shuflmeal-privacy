    <h1>ShuflMeal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ShuflMeal is a fully offline meal planning app. Your privacy is fundamental to how the app is designed — it does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data whatsoever.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>ShuflMeal collects no data.</strong> The app does not request internet access and has no network permission. All information you enter (meal names, daily plans, preferences, and profile details) is stored exclusively on your device in a local database.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using an embedded SQLite database. This data never leaves your device. If you uninstall the app, all data is permanently deleted.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>ShuflMeal does not share any data with third parties. There are no analytics services, advertising SDKs, crash reporting tools, or any other external services integrated into the app.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>ShuflMeal requests only one permission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — Used solely to send you optional daily meal reminders that you configure within the app. Notification content is generated locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Export Feature</h2>
    <p>The app includes an optional JSON export feature that saves your meal data to a file on your device. This file stays on your device and is only shared if you explicitly choose to share it using your device's share functionality.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ShuflMeal does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected at all, no special provisions are necessary.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us at: <a href="mailto:shuflmeal@proton.me">shuflmeal@proton.me</a></p>
